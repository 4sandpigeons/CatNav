# CatNav

CatNav shows you cats.

It borrows the API from the website random.cats, and displays random cat pictures gleaned from the API one at a time on http://localhost:5000/

To run, do ```python app.py```

Written in Python and HTML, relying on the Flask and requests modules.

The HTML in the Templates folder is borrowed and mangled from Boostrap's Starter Template. The only route used is '/', which brings up a new cat picture every time the page is refreshed. A great deal of room for expansion, like photos of different animals or even subcategories of cats.
