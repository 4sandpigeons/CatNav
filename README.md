# CatNav

#CatNav shows you cats.

#It borrows the API from the website random.cats, and displays random cat pictures from it one at a time on the LocalHost:5000/

#CatNav can be run from the command line /CatNav, via $python app,py.

#It is written in Python and HTML, relying on the Flask and requests modules.

#The HTML in the Templates folder is borrowed and mangled from Boostrap's Starter Template.

#The only route used is '/', which brings up a new cat picture every time the page is refreshed. A great deal of room for expansion, like photos of different animals or even subcategories of cats.
