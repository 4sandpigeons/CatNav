# CatNav
#This fetches the API from the random.cat website and displays the randomly generated jpg or gif on LocalHost:5000/
#This miraculous system changed my life, and it will change yours too.
#CatNav uses HTML, Flask, and Python. The HTML is blatantly borrowed (with permission) from Bootstrap's starter templates.
#The Python modules used are Flask and requests.
